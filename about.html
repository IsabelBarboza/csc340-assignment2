            <h1>About this website</h1>

        <p>
  My name is <strong>Isabel Barboza</strong>, I am 26 years old, and I have been a Dota 2 fan since around 2016.
  A high school friend introduced me to the game, and it quickly became my favorite.
</p>

<p>
  Even though my rank medal is not very high, I am very passionate about Dota 2.
  I enjoy learning from every match, improving my skills, and understanding the strategy behind the game.
</p>

<p>
  I created this website as part of my <strong> Software Engineering course at UNCG</strong>.
  While building this site, I practiced writing HTML structure, styling with CSS, and thinking about layout and design.
  This project helps me improve my technical skills while working on a topic that motivates me.
</p>

<p>
  I chose a warm design with strong visual elements because I wanted the site to feel powerful and immersive,
  similar to the atmosphere of Dota 2. The colors and style reflect intensity, focus, and personality.
</p>

<p>
  This website represents both who I am as a gamer and my growth as a software development student.
