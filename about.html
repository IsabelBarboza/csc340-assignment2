            <h1>About this website</h1>

            <p>
            My name is <strong>Isabel Barboza</strong>, I am 26 years old, and I have been a Dota 2 fan since around 2016.
            A high school friend introduced me to the game, and it quickly became my favorite.
            </p>

            <p>
            Even though my rank medal is not very high, I am very passionate about Dota 2.
            I enjoy learning from every match, improving my skills, and understanding the strategy behind the game.
            </p>

            <p>
            I created this website as part of my <strong> Software Engineering course at UNCG</strong>.
            While building this site, I practiced writing HTML structure, styling with CSS, and thinking about layout and design.
            This project helps me improve my technical skills while working on a topic that motivates me.
            </p>

            <p>
            I chose a <strong> dark and bold design </strong> with strong visual elements because I wanted the site to feel powerful and immersive,
            similar to the atmosphere of Dota 2. The colors and style reflect intensity, focus, and strong character identity.
            </p>
